										<h3>Looking for someone like me?</h3>
										<div class="intro-bubble">
										<p>I'm a Junior Web Developer with exceptional learning skills who can quickly get up to pace with your own working practices and make a positive impact on your business. I've got a <strong>First Class degree from Durham University</strong> in modern languages, Spanish and Italian, and now I'm applying those logical, analytical, and creative skills to the digital sphere. What's more, my working experience with online retailers has given me direct insight into a Web Agency's customer's needs - including SEO, conversion rates, front- and back-end ease of use, and practicality.</p>
										</div>
										<p>With my skills and background I'm ready to springboard into something new and find the right company to benefit from my enthusiasm!</p>
										
										<p>Be sure to check out my CV for a summary of my work experience, education, and skills - but take time to have a read of this profile and the process behind building this site for an insight into my mindset and goals.</p>
									

									<h3>Quick background</h3>

									<p>I'm a modern languages graduate with a bunch of (nerdy) interests, and whilst I've worked in marketing for a few years, now I'm taking a leap into Web development!</p>

									

									<p>Teenage forays into HTML during the <samp>&lt;table&gt;</samp> heydays of the Naughties and modding the videogame <em>Warcraft III</em> piqued my early interest and understanding of all things Code-y; but an uninspiring GCSE ICT course making spreadsheets for clothes stores led me to prefer a more human type of 'code' - languages.</p>

									<p>One First Class Honours Degree from Durham University in Spanish and Italian later and I'm back making spreadsheets for a clothes store, albeit with a hefty amount of VBA.</p>
									
									<p>But for the last 4 months I've been teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript and related technologies whilst building a fully functional WooCommerce site for my brother's casual clothing brand, University of Whatever. The experience has been both enjoyable and formative, and I can't wait to get more involved in the industry.</p>

									</div>

									<h3>A future in development</h3>

									<p>Aside from making swish spreadsheets to manage stock, Amazon listings, and SEO content for my brother's fashion brand <a href="http://www.universityofwhatever.co.uk/" target="_blank">University of Whatever</a>, I also built their shiny new website. A baptism by fire for sure, doing everything from installing WordPress on the server to using custom CSS to style the About Us page, manipulating back-end data import plugins and poking around in PHP. At times the process was challenging and cryptic, but as a result I've gained a broad experience in managing an eCommerce site based on a CMS, as well as using web languages HTML and CSS.</p>

									<p>Meanwhile I've been studying an <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/" target="_blank">online course created by Rob Percival</a> to get a more in-depth knowledge of key languages, concepts, and workflow processes within web development - including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL.</p>

									</div>

									<p>To demonstrate and solidify my learning so far, I built this site from scratch and published it through GitHub Pages. I documented the process I took - from wireframes in PhotoShop to polishing the style in CSS - and have posted it on this site as a reference for myself and as evidence that I do have some idea what I'm talking about. I urge you to check it out, and you can find all the code on <a href="https://github.com/alee8648" target="_blank">my GitHub profile</a>.</p>

							<div class="page-content-p">

								<h3>Why the explanation?</h3>

								<div class="intro-bubble">
									<p>I'm never happy with simply muddling through a process to get to the end result, so I've been careful in building my sites to gain an insight into what's going on as I do it. And how better to present my new webpage knowledge than in a webpage?</p>
								</div>

								<h3>Stage 1: Concept and Content Plan</h3>

								<p>So I want to make a website, but what exactly will go in it? It's important that the content shapes the design and not vice versa, so my first step was committing my ideas to pen and paper. A simple step, but referring back to these notes continuously throughout the rest of the process proved its worth.</p>

								<h3>Stage 2: Photoshop Wireframes</h3>

								<p>I took to Photoshop to quickly sketch out the different areas of the site using simple coloured boxes to represent <samp>&lt;div&gt;</samp> elements, and named the layers with the classes I would eventually use when coding. As the site is responsive, I made 3 different versions of the wireframes to demonstrate to myself how the site should adapt to the screen size. My design would ultimately change, but having that reference for class names, and a PSD file I could go back and play around with (and build my visual mock-up on) was invaluable.</p>

								<div class="body-image">
									<div class="body-image-inset" role="note">
										<p>Later style and practicality would better inform my boxy decisions</p>
									</div>

									<img src="images/adam-lee-portfolio-wireframes.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="The wireframes used on the site">

										
								</div>

								<h3>Stage 3: Visual Mock-up</h3>

								<p>Based on the wireframes, I began to add visual elements such as images, text, colours, and backgrounds to provide a goal to code towards. However, I admit I cheated by building the wireframes in code first to see how they'd look with Bootstrap's default styling. Or maybe that's not cheating at all?</p>

								<p>Nevertheless my first visual mock-up got scrapped almost completely, its definite estate agent flavour not coinciding with my design goals. The new look is fresher, more original, and appealing to the eye, and it's this second visual mock-up I've been building on since.</p>

								<div class="body-image">
									<div class="body-image-inset" role="note">
										<p>I like purple but... this resembled the worst of the Brighton letting agents I've experienced recently</p>
									</div>

									<img src="images/adam-portfolio-rejected-style.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="The site's original rejected style">

										
								</div>

								<h3>Stage 4: Content and Graphics</h3>

								<p>As content-writer and selfie-photographer for my own site I had to take some time out to actually write the stuff. Until the text and images were complete I used everyone's favourite fake Latin placeholder text and some fetching photographs of stacks of folders.</p>

								<p>I don't purport to be a graphic designer, but a working knowledge of Photoshop helped me to get the graphics I wanted for the site - including designing my own background.</p>

								<h3>Stage 5: HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>

								<p>Leaving the bulk of the styling work aside, I started coding by building the <samp>&lt;div&gt;</samp> framework using the classes from my wireframes PSD file and the content titles from my content plan. Knowing I would be using Bootstrap's grid system, I added the relevant <samp>container</samp>, <samp>row</samp>, and <samp>col-</samp> classes to create a responsive site before beginning on the true styling.</p>

								<p>With the goal of making the site functional before making it pretty, I also coded the JavaScript to allow switching between the content 'tabs'. This was achieved by giving the navigation buttons <samp>id</samp> attributes then using substrings to find the relevant content to display.</p>

								

								<h3>Stage 6: CSS</h3>

								<p>Some design elements from my visual mock-up were surprisingly easy to lift and apply in CSS, such as the gradient on the header, but others took a bit more fiddling and learning to get right - such as the image caption 'insets' that required different styling for different screen sizes to maintain a satisfying responsive experience.</p>

								<p>Now that I'd converted my mock-up into a website, I iterated on various elements of my design to make more informed decisions now that I could test them in the more natural setting of the browser.</p>

								<div class="body-image">
									<div class="body-image-inset" role="note">
										<p>I dare say there are more tricks to learn beyond my own brand of code organisation</p>
									</div>

									<img src="images/code-in-progress.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Code in progress">

										
								</div>

								<p>To write my code I used Sublime Text 3, and quickly became a fan of the Emmet package for shorthand HTML. I'm a shortcut junkie, and these tools scratched an itch when it came to make the process of code writing more efficient.</p>

								<h3>Stage 7: Hosting</h3>

								<p>Turns out Adam Lee is a fairly popular name, but the snazzy new .xyz domain was available - hopefully all the snazzier for Google's adoption of it. As I'd been keeping my site backed up and up-to-date on GitHub, hosting it there as a personal portfolio page made sense. And of course, it means <a href="https://github.com/alee8648" target="_blank" title="Adam Lee on GitHub">all the code is available publicly</a> there now, should you want to see it!</p>

								<h3>Stage 8: Future considerations</h3>

								<p>As a fledgling Web Developer, I'm well aware of my limitations. Keeping the site restricted to one HTML document made it easy to edit site-wide elements, such as the header and navigation, but in future the use of <strong>PHP</strong> would be a more comprehensive solution. Splitting the content to different pages would make for a more logical URL structure and avoid too much content being kept hidden with CSS.</p>

								<p>I also hope to develop the JavaScript and jQuery functions of the page to create a more interactive and appealing experience. For example, animating the switch between tabs would create a smoother user experience, as would more dynamic captions and page insets. As a gamer and UX snob, I find the feel of a website or user interface to be a driving factor in how long I'm willing to spend using it. Identifying exactly what makes these experiences so satisfying is one of the most exciting aspects of web development to me.</p>

								<p>As I continue to learn more, I intend that the site grow with me as a demonstration of my abilities.</p>
